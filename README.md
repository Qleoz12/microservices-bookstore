# Bookstore website with a Microservices Architecture

This repository shows the development of a bookstore website using the microservices architecture.
To implement this architecture, I used:
* the latest version of Java, Java 11;
* the latest version of Spring Boot, Spring Boot 2.3.5;
* Docker to package the application;
* and Kubernetes to manage the microservices.
